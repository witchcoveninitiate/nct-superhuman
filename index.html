		<h2>About NCT 127</h2>
		<p>NCT 127 is the second sub unit of NCT (Neo Culture Technology) and debuted in 2016 with their first mini-album. Its lead single was Firetruck. Afterwards, in 2017, NCT 127 released their second mini-album LIMITLESS. This mini-album brought NCT 127 many new fans with songs like Limitless, Back 2 U, and Baby don't like it. However, NCT 127 first achieved widespread popularity with the release of their 3rd mini-album Cherry Bomb, which contains NCT 127 cult favorites, Cherry Bomb and Whiplash. </p>
		<p> Since then, NCT 127 has released 2 full albums, Regular-Irregular and Neozone, a fourth mini-album, and one live album. Besides the songs already mentioned, my favorite songs of NCT 127's also include Touch, Superhuman, Jetlag, Highway to Heaven, and Nonstop. </p>

		<h2>why superhuman needs to be discussed more in ncity</h2>
		<p class="caption"> maybe this is because of the release timing of their fourth mini-album but I feel like Superhuman does not get all of the praise and recognition it deserves among nctzens</p>
		<p>I love the sci-fi concept and all of the edits that the editors did for the music video. The costumes are fantastic, and I love Yuta with that red/orange hair color. Additionally, Haechan's line "my hope was all but gone" alone requires at least a second listen.</p>
